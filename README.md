Create beautiful product catalogs or menus served on IPFS.

Built for the HackFS 2021 hackathon.

### Inspiration


Pain points:
* To create a hosted product catalog, usually you'd need to pay a hosted provider like squarespace or shopify.
* Many of these existing providers don't integrate cryptocurrency
* Providers aren't distributed and suffer downsides of existing centralized platforms (vendor lock in, variable pricing, outages, etc.)
<!-- * IPFS powered receipts and transaction record keeping. -->


<!-- 
### Technologies used
* IPFS (Hosting and sharing of assets)
* Pillar (payments and wallet creation)

-->

### How to run

Define the following env variables
<pre>
    REACT_APP_STORAGE_KEY = {YOUR_WEB3_STORAGE_KEY}
</pre>

`yarn; yarn start`

### Future Work
* Integrate payments and checkout flows directly from the catalog (enable the product to be used table side)
